# ðŸš€ Full-Stack Monorepo Starter
Welcome to the Full-Stack Monorepo Starter! This repository complements the article published on Medium, providing practical support for building efficient TypeScript full-stack web applications using a monorepo structure.

## ðŸ‘‹ Overview
This starter project is designed to align with the concepts discussed in the [Medium article](https://thelicato.medium.com/crafting-a-shared-typescript-package-for-full-stack-web-apps-9163385b3a85), helping you kickstart your journey into full-stack TypeScript web development. It demonstrates the power of sharing code, types, and utilities between the backend and frontend, enhancing collaboration and consistency across the stack.

## ðŸ’¡ Features
 - **Monorepo Structure**: Organize your project with separate packages for the backend and frontend, facilitating code sharing and scalability.

 - **Shared Package**: Explore how to create and manage a shared TypeScript package for common types and utilities, promoting code reusability.

 - **pnpm Integration**: Learn how to leverage the pnpm package manager for efficient dependency management within a monorepo, reducing redundancy and saving disk space.

## ðŸŒŸ Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thelicato/full-stack-monorepo-starter.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd full-stack-monorepo-starter
```

1. Follow the step-by-step guide provided in your Medium article to dive into the intricacies of building a TypeScript full-stack web application using this starter project.

Feel free to experiment, modify, and adapt the codebase to your specific project requirements, using the knowledge gained from the Medium article as your guide.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure
This project adheres to a monorepo structure, which separates the backend and frontend into their respective directories:

 - backend/: Contains the Express.js backend application.
 - frontend/: Houses the React.js frontend application.
 - bff/: Demonstrates the creation and management of a shared TypeScript package for common types and utilities.
